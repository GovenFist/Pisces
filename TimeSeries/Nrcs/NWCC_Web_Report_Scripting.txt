Note that the following shell scripts use the 'curl' utility.
If using the 'wget'utility, change syntax to be something like this
wget \
-o wget.log \

Using an inventory.csv file to construct a period of record pull of data
========================================================================
To get a list of SCAN stations with start and end years, use our inventory,
choosing 'SCAN' as the network and 'Download'.
        http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/nwcc/inventory

Once you get the inventory you want, save it in csv format
You can parse this file (using awk if unix) to create a script
to get period of record script data for the files you need.
        station id
        start wateryear
        end wateryear
